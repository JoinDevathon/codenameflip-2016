## Instructions
The plugin itself will but you into a special "machine mode" immediately when you join the server. In this mode you will see the world from the eyes of a machine.

Imminent threats to your safety are predicted (for Skeletons and Creepers) and will provide you with options to neutralize the situation. Simply walk up to a creeper, strike it with lightning (or alternatively walk up to a skeleton and let it shoot), and keep an eye on chat.

I ran out of most of my time to complete looking for __ALL__ possible mob situations along with as many SituationActions as I wanted. But this most certainly provides proof of concept.

For any reasons if the plugin does not properly fire when interacting with the entities you can run /debug for a mock up of a situation and how options are evaluated.
